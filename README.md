## Microservices setup

Please make sure that you have docker running before proceeding further.
Run the below command in your terminal upon loading up our application.

```
cd services
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Required dependencies
***Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running docker-compose build***

**Stripe CLI listener**

This is for the stripe webhook to work. Please install the stripe CLI listener by following the steps below.

```
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

sudo stripe login --interactive

sudo stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5001/stripe_webhook
```

If you do not have brew installed, then run the following command in your terminal.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
-   source: https://brew.sh/

**Android Studio Device Emulator**

This is to receive the push notification from the server (to simulate scenario 3). Please install Android Studio and use it to open the android project in the folder named android. You will need an apropriate emulator to run the application. In Android Studio, use Tools -> Device Manager -> Create Device to create a new emulator. The emulator must be running in order to receive the push notification. Our team used a Pixel 2 API Upside Down Cake to emulate the receipt of the push notification.

*When running the application for the first time, a token will be generated by the emulator in the Android Studio terminal. Copy the token and paste it into services/fcm_cloud_messaging.py on line 13. This is to allow the server to send push notifications to the emulator.*

## Front end setup

Please make sure that you have node.js installed for this before proceeding further.
Run the below command in your terminal upon loading up our application.

```

```
